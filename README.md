It's no secret that iTunes support on Windows is terrible. For me, one of the most annoying bugs is when iTunes decides to just hang. All GUI elements (including, importantly, the close button) stop responding in any way to user input, forcing me to open a task manager, kill the process, and restart it. I've tried every solution I could think of and come up with nothing, so today I finally sat down and wrote this short program which I can run in the background. It will scan for an iTunes instance and, if it starts to hang, it will give you the option of killing and restarting the process.
